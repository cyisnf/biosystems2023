This is the code used for the simulations in the paper "Causal intuition in the indefinite world: meta-analysis and simulations" submitted to BioSystems.
Running the source code corresponding to each simulation will output the figures shown in the paper.
To output a figure of simulation C, two codes need to be executed. The data is generated by executing "simC_data_generator.py" and then the figure is output by executing "simC_plotter.py".
