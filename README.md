All source codes for this site are used for the meta-analysis and the simulations in our paper "Causal intuition in the indefinite world: meta-analysis and simulations" submitted to BioSystems.

# Meta-analysis

We include the source code for the meta-analysis of human causal functions conducted in our paper.
If you run the meta-analysis program, you can reproduce Table 2 in our paper.

# Simulations

We include the source code for the computer simulations performed in our paper.
The simulation results of our paper can be reproduced by executing the corresponding Python source code in the table below, respectively.
Each source code has the same settings as the parameters described in our paper.
Please reduce the number of generated tables or the number of simulations when checking the behavior.
Note: By default, run time is 30 minutes to 12 hours

# Install

Clone repository and install requirements.txt in a Python>= 3.9.12 environment

```
git clone https://github.com/cyisnf/paris_biosys
cd paris_biosys
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Tutorials

## meta-analysis

Running the source code XXXX.py will output XXX shown in the paper.

```
python meta_analysis.py
```

## Simulations

Running the source code corresponding to each simulation will output the figures shown in the paper.
The method of execution differs depending on whether the simulation C or otherwise.

### Simulation: Aa, Ab, Ba, Bb, Bc, D

For example, Simulation Aa in our paper is performed as follows;

```
python simAa_preventive.py
```

After execution, matplotlib will draw a graph on the display.
When the graph is closed, a folder with the name of the simulation is created in the current directory, and a pdf of the graph is saved in that folder.

### Simulation: C

Two codes need to be executed to output a figure of simulation C.
The data is generated by executing "simC_data_generator.py," and then the figure is output by executing "simC_plotter.py."
